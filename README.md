# vn-exercise

I chose to use TypeScript to do this exercise, so to run it, you must install the dev dependencies and build the project.

There are scripts to build the files and also to run the exercises.

I've also used Jest to write unit tests.

About exercise 2, I wasn't sure if I should create an object with all items or write a function for each item. Either way, I did both. Another question was whether I should use German as a fixed language in one of the items or if it was just an example, but I created an argument for the language and passed it fixed in the aggregate function.
